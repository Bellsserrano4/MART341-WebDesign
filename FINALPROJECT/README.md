How did your user testing sessions go?
    Overall the tesing went pretty well. It was pretty lengthy but very helpful in the end. I used two people I am accquantices with so I wouldn't have any bias in my testing techniques.
What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
    I didn;t reallyu make any major changes, just switched up colors to make the website flow a little more. 
Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?
    I struggled with figuring out how to get back and forth between pages within the website but went back and took the time to watch each tutorial so it was user friendly!
